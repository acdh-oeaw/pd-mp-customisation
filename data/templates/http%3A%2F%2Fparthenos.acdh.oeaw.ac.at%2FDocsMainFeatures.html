          <p>This page informs about main features of PARTHENOS disovery.</p>
    
          <p>There are three main modes to explore the dataset:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="#search">Search</a></li>
            <li><a href="#explore">Explore via the underlying model/ontology</a></li>
            <li><a href="#detail">Custom detail views for main entities</a></li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="search">Search</h2>
          <p>PARTHENOS Discovery offers multiple modes of searching and exploring the underlying dataset:<p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="#search_fulltext">Full-text search</a></li>
            <li><a href="#search_faceted">Faceted search</a></li>
            <li><a href="#search_querybuilder">Search based on the relations between entities (Query builder)</a></li>
            <li><a href="#search_sparql">SPARQL</a></li>
          </ul>

          <h3 id="search_fulltext">Full-text search</h3>
          <p>This method, used by most search engines, searches for matching text within data items. Its usefulness may be limited by the large numbers of results returned, some of which may not be relevant, but its advantage is that it works directly on the content and does not require any metadata. A more detailed explanation can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-text_search">here</a>.</p>

          <h3 id="search_faceted">Faceted search</h3>
          <p>Faceted search provides a more targeted search method by making use of specific data fields, i.e. Entities and Sub-classes, to narrow down the returned results.  Aspects such as defined time periods, geographical location and matching concepts (e.g. female = woman = women) can be exploited by faceted search where these exist in the underlying data model and appear in the metadata. A simple example of faceted search are online shopping catalogues where several filters can be applied to narrow down the available products, e.g. as used by Amazon. Metaphacts, the faceted search facility used for PARTHENOS Discovery, makes use of knowledge graphs (and allied technologies RDF, RDFS & OWL, SPARQL and SKOS) to enable end users to explore the PARTHENOS dataset by applying filters through a navigation interface to obtain data of interest. Further information about faceted search can be found here. A practical demo of faceted search in action can be explored in ResearchSpace which is the discovery application developed on top of Metaphacts used by the British Museum <a href="https://public.researchspace.org/resource/Start">here</a>.</p>

          <h3 id="search_querybuilder">Search based on relations between entities (Query builder)</h3>
          <p>See a detailed desciption on the help page of <a href="https://help.metaphacts.com/resource/Help:SemanticSearch">Metaphacts SemanticSearch</a>.</p>

          <h3 id="search_sparql">SPARQL</h3>
          <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL">SPARQL</a> is the language for querying RDF data (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/">specification</a>). It requires some practice to master, but allows its user to query the data for any custom complex patterns. In Metaphactory, all the data displayed to the user is retrieved from the underlying triplestore via predefined SPARQL queries.<br />
          In many places in the user interface, the underlying SPARQL query is linked, allowing the user to run the query separately (in a dedicated generic <a title="SPARQL-query interface" href="/sparql">SPARQL-query interface</a>) and to adjust it further on demand. One very simple example of this is the option to adjust the size of the results set (with the keyword "LIMIT"):<br />
          When listing items in the user interface, the underlying queries are mostly restricted to 100 up to 1000 items for practical and performance reasons. When the user wants to see more items, this can be done by running the SPARQL query separately with the LIMIT adjusted accordingly.</p>

          <h2 id="explore">Explore the data via the underlying model</h2>
          <p>Specific to an RDF-based knowledge graph, is that the model underlying the data (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)">ontology</a>) is represented in the same form as the data itself. Thus a corresponding database (called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore">triplestore</a>") and any applications operating on RDF-graphs can handle both the data and the model. This means that the entities of the model (called "classes" and "properties") can be explored in much the same way as the instance data.<br />
          In PARTHENOS Discovery we took advantage of this feature providing views for the classes and properties of the model that feature the definition of given entity, its relation to other entities of the model (e.g. subclasses and superclasses) as well as its usage, i.e. showing sample entities of given class.<br />
          For example, you can explore the class <semantic-link title="Home" uri='[[resolvePrefix "crm:E39_Actor"]]'>Actor</semantic-link> and in the tab "Instances" you see listed instances or individuals of type Actor. The tab "Usage" summarizes the relations or properties instances of Actor are described with. So for example the following table row:</p>
          <table class="table">
            <tbody>
              <tr class="standard-row">
                <td>
                  <span><semantic-link title="Home" uri='[[resolvePrefix "crm:P76_has_contact_point"]]'>has contact point</semantic-link></span>
                </td>
                <td>
                  <span><semantic-link title="Home" uri='[[resolvePrefix "crm:E45_Address"]]'>Address</semantic-link></span>
                </td>
                <td>
                  <span><a href="/resource/p:StPOt?st=http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/E39_Actor&ot=http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/E45_Address&p=http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/P76_has_contact_point">32582</a></span>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
          <p>This means that in 32582 cases Place instances have a property “has contact point” with an Address. When you click on the number you get the list of the corresponding Place-Address pairs.</p>

          <h2 id="detail">Detail Views</h2>
          <p>Via "detail views" you can explore each entity in the dataset in detail.<br />
          Next to a generic view (tab "Source statements") which lists all the properties of a given entity, for the main types custom views are available, which take into account the specifics of given type. For example, for Places there is a separate tab with a map, where the places are located on the geographical map (provided the corresponding spatial coordinates have been provided).<br />
          If there is an image representation for a given entity, it is also displayed in the header as a thumbnail.<br />
          In the tab "minimal metadata", most relevant properties of given entity, customized per type are displayed for quick overview.</p>
