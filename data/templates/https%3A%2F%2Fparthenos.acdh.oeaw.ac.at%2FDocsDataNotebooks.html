          <h1>Data Notebooks</h1>
            
          <p>This page informs about possibilities to explore the PARTHENOS dataset programmatically through <a href="https://jupyter.org">Jupyter notebooks</a> using python programming language.</p>
					<p>
             The data notebooks are  increasingly popular and very effective way to develop and run code through your browser. Therefore they are ideal means for manifold data science tasks especially for working in a collaborative distributed environment. They allow radically simplified sharing and reproducibility (your colleague can completely "re-play" your notebook)
            
You do need a dedicated [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) environment, however next to simple options to setup one locally, there are more and more offers providing appropriate environment as a service.
         </p>
          
          <p>In the dedicated GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/pd-labs">acdh-oeaw/pd-labs</a> there is <a href="https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/pd-labs#data-notebooks" >more information on the use of Jupyter noteboooks</a>, as well as a <a href="https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/pd-labs/blob/master/scripts/ipynb/Querying%20PD.ipynb" >sample Jupyter notebook (Querying PD.ipynb)</a> demonstrating possible programmatic interaction with the PARTHENOS dataspace.</p>
